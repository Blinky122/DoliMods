Dear DoliCloud user,<br>
<br>
Your instance <strong>https://__instance__.on.dolicloud.com</strong> has been temporarly disabled.<br>
<br>
Your instance has been disabled by our automatic process because your monthly payment has failed too many times. Payments are still in failure 15 days after first emails to warn you to fix this from your dashboard:<br>
- May be your credit card or paypal information expired.<br>
- May be your bank has refused our request for any other reason.<br>
<br>
To restore access to your instance, first thing to do is to go onto your dashboard to 
check and fix payment information. For this click this link:<br>
<a href="https://www.on.dolicloud.com">https://www.on.dolicloud.com</a>.<br>
<br>
Check also into your dashboard that your email is still correct (you may did not receive payments warnings if your email was wrong).<br>
<br>
Once this is done, or if you think this is an error, send an email to <a href="email:support@dolicloud.com">support@dolicloud.com</a> to ask us to 
enable your instance. Note that if you don't fix this during the next 15 days, your instance will be definitely destroyed, and all your data lost.<br> 
<br>
